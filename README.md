## first login
1. in pycharm choose Git->clone
2. paste the git repo url in the parent folder (e.g. PycharmProjects), project's folder will be created automatically
3. make a small change to the project (like updating the readme)
4. commit
5. push (this step can't be easy, need to check what happens if no credentials...)






just some update on the main branch (todo renove this later)
